# FRP Management Panel API

[![CodeQL](https://github.com/shawngao-org/frp-admin/actions/workflows/github-code-scanning/codeql/badge.svg)](https://github.com/shawngao-org/frp-admin/actions/workflows/github-code-scanning/codeql)

Welcome to the FRP Management Panel API documentation. 
This API allows you to manage your FRP (Fast Reverse Proxy) instances programmatically. 
You can configure proxies, manage connections, and retrieve logs using simple HTTP requests.

## Features

- **RESTful API**: Manage your FRP instances via standard HTTP methods.
- **Secure Authentication**: Protect your endpoints with token-based authentication.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Retrieve real-time data about your proxies and connections.
- **Log Management**: Access and filter logs through API endpoints.
- **Multi-Server Management**: Manage multiple FRP instances through a unified API.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- FRPS and the server for the project are installed.
- An API client (e.g., `curl`, Postman) to interact with the API endpoints.

> Tip: You can also implement your own Web panel. (I might do it someday.)

### Setup

> Need to be improved

Be sure to customize each part with the actual details of your FRP Management Panel API, its authentication method, 
and endpoint information. Itâ€™s important to provide clear, detailed guidelines for consumers of your API, 
so they can integrate with it effectively.
